The image.png has a QR code that contains a link that takes to a github gist page that has link to a zip file to move forward in your game.

The image seems a bit dull doesn't it?

To see the actual image, you need to apply the following function:

replace all the pixels with value 2 as 255 (2 ---> 255 )

We have provided a template for you in files named code_in_python.py and code_in_c.c in python and c respectively.

Note: Fill the missing parts in any one of the templates given & run it.

Note : If you tamper the original image one more wont be provided.

Note : If you see a folder named ".stb_image", ignore it. it's just has required libraries for C code image manipulation.

Note: People using .c file run the code using 
       gcc <filename> -lm
              or
       g++ <filename>
       
Note: People using .py file, if getting any errors like "module not found",
		run "pip3 install opencv-python"(without quotes) in your  terminal or command prompt.
		
The QR code in output.png has the link to the github gist.
